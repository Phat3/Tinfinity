\section{High level application description}

\subsection{Description}
Tinfnity is a mobile application that implements a proximity chat system whose aim to connect people which reside in the same area. In order to access this applicaton, the user must connect his Facebook account and share some of his informations like photos and interests. Once the user has been successfully logged in the application, he can discover all the people that are using Tinfinity near to him using the map as shown in Figure 1. If the user find someone interesting on the map, he can tap on the marker and send a friendship request as shown in Figure 2.

When and if recipient accepts the request, as shown in Figure 3, they can start chatting and maybe know each other directly in person. Also, when the friendship is granted, the two users can continue to chat even if they are no longer near such a normal chat system as Whatsapp for example, shown in Figure 4.
