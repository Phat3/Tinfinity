\section{Architecture}
The architectures of the application is composed by two main parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item An client IOS application
\item A server web application
\end{itemize}
The web application is necessary because it has to keep track of the users data, location and handle the chat system.. A general overview of the comunication between the mobile application and the web application is shown in Figure 7.
